# KerbalKontroller
Repository for the source code, schematics and all things related to this custom controller for Kerbal Space Program

## Setup
Install the KSP Mod Simpit (currently using this [version](https://github.com/PBechon/KerbalSimpitRevamped/releases/tag/v2.0-alpha-6)).

It includes the Arduino library, which should be installed for the sketch to be properly compiled.

Upload the sketch in [this folder](https://github.com/Boni42/KerbalKontroller/tree/main/ArduinoKode) to the Arduino. The wiring schematic is available [here](https://github.com/Boni42/KerbalKontroller/blob/main/circuit.png).

Connect the controller before starting KSP.

On connection error, unplug the controller, restart the serial port and plug it again.
